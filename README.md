# Wordle Application:

## Description:
This is a Wordle simulation, similar to the popular mobile/pc game found here: [New York Times - Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 
This application was made for my Assessment 3 in my ICTPRG302-Introduction-To-Programming(Python) course, during my Certificate III at North Metropolitan TAFE. 

## Installation:
To obtain and use this application, you must:
- Have an IDE - preferably Idle, PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
- Download all the files in this repository - the testing document is optional
- Make sure all the .txt files are in the same folder as the main program
- Open the main program in your IDE
- Run the program and enjoy the game.

## Contributing:
While this is a public repository, please refrain from suggesting changes or reporting bugs.

*Hey Jas, I've edited your readme so you can test PR's!*
